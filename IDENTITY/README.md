# Rubrik Identity Auditing Scripts for Licensing

## Overview

This repository contains a suite of PowerShell scripts designed specifically for Rubrik's customers to audit their user identities for licensing purposes. The scripts connect to both on-premises Active Directory (AD) and Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) to count the number of unique human identities. This data is then used to ensure fair and accurate licensing of Rubrik's products.

The primary goal of these scripts is to distinguish between human users and non-human accounts (e.g., service accounts, applications) to avoid over-licensing. The scripts generate detailed reports that can be shared with Rubrik.

## Scripts

This repository contains two main scripts:

1.  **`Get-AdHumanIdentity.ps1`**: For auditing on-premises Active Directory.
2.  **`Get-EntraHumanIdentity.ps1`**: For auditing Microsoft Entra ID.

## `Get-AdHumanIdentity.ps1`

This script is a Rubrik utility for counting human identities in a customer's Active Directory (AD) environment. The data collected is used for licensing Rubrik's products. The script identifies and categorizes all user and service accounts to determine the number of unique human users.

### Features

-   **Multi-Domain Auditing**: Scans a single domain, a list of specified domains, or all domains in the current forest.
-   **Account Classification**: Categorizes user accounts based on their activity status to help differentiate between human and non-human accounts:
    -   **Active**: Users who have logged in within the last 180 days.
    -   **Inactive**: Users who have not logged in for more than 180 days.
    -   **Never Logged In**: Accounts that have never recorded a logon event.
-   **Service Account Detection**: Identifies different types of non-human accounts to exclude them from the human identity count:
    -   Managed Service Accounts (MSA)
    -   Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA)
    -   Accounts with the `PasswordNeverExpires` flag set.
    -   Accounts matching custom naming patterns (e.g., `*svc*`, `*_bot`).
-   **Flexible Reporting**: Generates reports in two modes:
    -   `UserPerOU`: A detailed breakdown of accounts per Organizational Unit (OU).
    -   `Summary`: A high-level summary of accounts per domain.
-   **CSV Export**: Automatically exports the audit results to a timestamped CSV file that can be shared with Rubrik.
-   **Logging**: Creates a detailed log file for each execution, capturing all actions and potential errors.

### Prerequisites

-   **PowerShell Version**: 5.1 or later.
-   **Active Directory Module**: The `ActiveDirectory` PowerShell module must be installed. This is typically included with the Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) for Active Directory Domain Services.
-   **Permissions**: The user running the script must have sufficient permissions to read user and service account information from the target Active Directory domains.

### Parameters

| Parameter                     | Description                                                                                                                           | Required | Default Value |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| -------- | ------------- |
| `SpecificDomains`             | An array of fully qualified domain names to audit (e.g., `"corp.domain.local"`). If omitted, all domains in the forest are audited.   | No       | (All domains in the forest) |
| `UserServiceAccountNamesLike` | An array of wildcard patterns to identify service accounts by name (e.g., `"*svc*"`, `"*_bot*"`).                                     | No       | (None)        |
| `Mode`                        | The reporting mode. Can be `UserPerOU` for a detailed report or `Summary` for a domain-level summary.                                 | Yes      | `UserPerOU`   |

### Usage Examples

**Example 1: Audit all domains in the forest with a detailed per-OU report.**

```powershell
.\Get-AdHumanIdentity.ps1 -Mode UserPerOU
```

**Example 2: Audit a specific domain and identify service accounts by name, with a summary report.**

```powershell
.\Get-AdHumanIdentity.ps1 -SpecificDomains "corp.domain.local" -UserServiceAccountNamesLike "*svc*", "*_bot*" -Mode Summary
```

### Output

-   **CSV Report**: A CSV file named `UserAudit_<Mode>_<timestamp>.csv` is created in the `ADReports` directory.
-   **Log File**: A log file named `AD_Audit_<timestamp>.log` is created in the `ADReports` directory.

## `Get-EntraHumanIdentity.ps1`

This script is a Rubrik utility for counting human identities in a customer's Entra ID tenant. The data collected is used for licensing Rubrik's products. The script connects to the Microsoft Graph API to identify and categorize all user accounts, service principals, and applications to determine the number of unique human users.

### Features

-   **Microsoft Graph Integration**: Connects to Microsoft Graph with the necessary permissions to read identity data.
-   **User Activity Analysis**: Identifies inactive users based on a configurable number of days of inactivity to help differentiate between active and dormant human users.
-   **Service Account Identification**: Flags potential service accounts based on naming patterns in their User Principal Name (UPN) to exclude them from the human identity count.
-   **Application and Service Principal Ownership**: Optionally performs a deep scan to count the number of applications and service principals owned by each user, which helps in distinguishing human from non-human accounts.
-   **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates reports in two modes:
    -   `Full`: A detailed per-user report.
    -   `Summary`: An aggregated report by domain.
-   **Multiple Export Formats**: Exports reports in both CSV and a user-friendly HTML format, which can be shared with Rubrik.
-   **Automated Module Installation**: Checks for and installs the required Microsoft Graph PowerShell modules if they are not already present.
-   **Logging**: Creates a detailed log file for each execution.

### Prerequisites

-   **PowerShell Version**: 7.0 or later.
-   **Microsoft Graph Modules**: The script requires the following PowerShell modules:
    -   `Microsoft.Graph.Users`
    -   `Microsoft.Graph.Applications`
    -   `Microsoft.Graph.Identity.DirectoryManagement`
    The script will attempt to install these modules automatically if they are missing.
-   **Permissions**: The user running the script must have permissions to grant consent for the required Microsoft Graph API scopes (`User.Read.All`, `Directory.Read.All`, `Application.Read.All`, `AuditLog.Read.All`). This may require an administrator account.

### Parameters

| Parameter                     | Description                                                                                                | Required | Default Value |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------- |
| `UserServiceAccountNamesLike` | An array of patterns to identify service accounts by their UPN (e.g., `"svc-"`, `"sa-"`).                  | No       | (None)        |
| `Mode`                        | The reporting mode. Can be `Full` for a detailed report or `Summary` for an aggregated report.             | Yes      | `Full`        |
| `DaysInactive`                | The number of days of inactivity to use when flagging users as inactive.                                   | No       | `180`         |
| `CheckOwnership`              | A switch parameter that, when present, enables the time-consuming check for application and service principal ownership. | No       | (Not present) |

### Usage Examples

**Example 1: Generate a full report with ownership analysis, for users inactive for 90 days.**

```powershell
.\Get-EntraHumanIdentity.ps1 -Mode Full -DaysInactive 90 -CheckOwnership
```

**Example 2: Generate a summary report, identifying service accounts with "svc-" in their UPN.**

```powershell
.\Get-EntraHumanIdentity.ps1 -Mode Summary -UserServiceAccountNamesLike "svc-"
```

### Output

-   **CSV Reports**: CSV files are created in the `EntraReports` directory (e.g., `Full_ByUser_<timestamp>.csv`, `Full_ByDomain_<timestamp>.csv`).
-   **HTML Report**: A single HTML file summarizing the audit is created in the `EntraReports` directory (e.g., `Full_Report_<timestamp>.html`).
-   **Log File**: A log file named `EntraAudit_<timestamp>.log` is created in the `EntraReports` directory.
